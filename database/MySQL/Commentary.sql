Luke 3:23-38 presents a different lineage of Jesus which is one of blood descent - the personal genealogy of Joseph. Together, the intent of these genealogies is to show that, both legally and literally, Jesus was the "son of David", and the true King of Israel.</p>\n<p>Matthew''s genealogy is accurate in the sense that "begat" is better translated as "is the ancestor of" but why certain names were not included in the line of kings is not apparent to modern historians. However, it must have been acceptable as presented  to the Jews of his day.</p>\n<p>Some propose that Luke''s genealogy is really that of Mary. However, Luke clearly says it''s Joseph''s genealogy. Mary''s genealogy is never given in the scriptures. However, since the Messiah was to be the literal seed of David so Mary and Joseph must have shared a close common relative. The logical conclusion is that Joseph and Mary were first cousins which was common in Middle Eastern cultures.</p>\n\nFrom the Catholic Encyclopedia...<br>\n<blockquote>Lord A. Hervey, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who wrote a learned work on the "Genealogies of Our Lord Jesus Christ", thinks that Mary was the daughter of Jacob, and Joseph was the son of Jacob''s brother, Heli. Mary and Joseph were therefore first cousins, and both of the house of David. Jacob, the elder, having died without male issue, transmitted his rights and privileges to the male issue of his brother Heli, Joseph, who according to genealogical usage was his descendant.</blockquote>', '', ''),

By this, I mean the mocking of people of faith as being ignorant, superstitious, illogical and therefore dangerous. Intolerance has been around for centuries and is wrong in all its forms.</p>\n\n<p>Most atheists and agnostics are pretty confident that no one can prove there is a God. And in fact most serious discussions (or arguments) regarding of the existence of God revolve around some sort of proof or lack thereof. Therefore, I wish to discuss the subject in terms of simple numerical analysis. To start with I propose to show that, when you run the numbers using only the science we have now, the odds lean heavily in favor of the existence of intelligent beings much more advanced than ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that in the observable universe there is estimated* to be 800,000,000,000 (800 billion) galaxies with an average number of 4,000,000,000 (4 billion) stars in each galaxy. That makes for 3,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3200 trillion trillion ) stars total. So how likely is it that our earth is the only inhabited planet with "intelligent life". It''s simply impossible from a practical standpoint. To demonstrate, lets take a conservative approach on how many planets like our there might be out of 3200 trillion trillion possibilities. Based on the number of extra-solar planets that have been found to date, it''s estimated that at least 10% of all solar systems have planets - so that''s somewhere between 10% to 100%. At 10% (I am being conservative), that leaves only 320 trillion trillion solar systems with a potential terrestrial (rocky) earth-like planet. Let''s say that only half of the remaining solar systems have a rocky "terrestrial" type planet (very reasonable, since our own solar system has 4 rocky planets out of 8 total) and that only half of those are around the size of the earth (our solar system has two: Earth and Venus - Mercury and Mars are too small). Now we''re down to only 80 trillion trillion solar systems with an Earth sized planet. We know that the distance from the Sun is important for life. In our Solar system there are 63,375 possible orbits between the Sun and Jupiter (each orbit with a width of 8,000 miles). So if by pure chance our Earth inhabits precisely the right distance from the Sun for life to thrive then the odds are that there are at least 12,623,274,161,735,700 (12.6 million trillion) earth-like planets at just the right distance from it''s Sun. You''re probably getting bored with numbers by now but perhaps you see the point that when you start out with such a large number like 3200 trillion trillion** stars, it''s simply impossible to reasonably reduce the odds to a small number.</p>\n\n<p>So, now we''re talking about 12.5 million trillion planets with the right conditions for life in general. Well, if evolution is the only way (we''re being conservative again) for intelligent life*** to exist and we follow our own earths evolutionary example then each planet will have intelligent life at some point in it''s history. Since it apparently takes about 4.5 billion years for the earth to be ready for life to evolve to an intelligent state, then only 6.25 million trillion planets are left that could harbor intelligent life at this very minute. Of course, some intelligent life could have become extinct through wars, disease, or natural disaster (like large meteorites) but since it only takes 2.5 million years for intelligent life to re-evolve then that process could, with no overlap, occur 200 more times on a planet like earth capable of supporting life for 500,000,000 additional years (conservative estimate).</p>\n<br>\n<big><b>There is a God</b></big>\n\n<p>So far I have used conservative estimates applied to the observable universe only which resulted in 6.5 million trillion earth-like planets that could each evolve intelligent life 200 times over. In our recorded history science didn''t really take off until a mere 180 years ago and now it is progressing very rapidly. Very rapidly indeed, and if we humans continue at this pace how much progress will be made in 1000 more years? How about 100,000 or 100 million years? After all we''ve got PLENTY of time since the Sun won''t make earth uninhabitable for another 500 million years or so. It seems obvious that after a few million years of scientific progress, those humans of the future would be like gods to us and having attained moral perfection, they would indeed be gods by our definition. They would have mastered physics, quantum mechanics, and the "theory of everything" and be fully aware of all the dimensions of space, the processes of life, and able to use all that knowledge in ways that would be totally fantastical to us, including "terra-forming" — and not only interrupting the natural processes from time to time, but actually creating and controlling what the "natural" processes are. The human genome would be fully deciphered so that they would have long ago taken complete charge of evolution and this would allow the aging process to be defeated. The brain would be augmented and current brain limitations eliminated so that progress would accelerate even faster than now.</p>\n\n<p>So there you have it. By the numbers there are other earths with intelligent life, and many with God-like intelligence. So, in general, how can one possibly NOT believe there is a god-like being? The numbers say there are at least millions of trillions of them. Religion simply says that there''s at least one. A VERY VERY reasonable idea. In fact, by the numbers, everything else is totally unreasonable. The universe is simply too big for our little planet to be the unique center of anything.</p>\n<br>\n<br> - Jay Mackley\n<br>\n<p>P.S. If my numerical hypothesis''s are correct then that brings us to "Fermi''s Paradox". Recognizing the arguments for superior intelligent life, he is reputed to have asked "So, where is everybody?"

(44, 'english', 'The Prime Elective', 'Doctrine', '', 'Essay', '<br><p>I call it the PRIME ELECTIVE to choose God over everything else — the decision to follow Jesus Christ with this thought: "When I know His will for sure, I''ll do WHATEVER He wants, regardless of the cost. He doesn''t have to prove himself to me - I trust Him totally."</p>\n\n<p>When I was a full-time missionary a man once told me "I wouldn''t join your church if Jesus Christ himself told me to!" Many people who would never say it out loud, nevertheless act out the same thought in their daily lives by intentionally giving top priority to their own wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>Obeying the PRIME ELECTIVE is simple: we set our own limited wisdom aside and follow Christ''s commandments and example regardless of the cost or the apparent external logic of it, like a small child submits to their loving parents. The scriptures express this readiness in several ways: ""being meek and humble", "loving God", "having a heart of flesh instead of stone",  "having a contrite spirit", and "seeking God with all of our mind and strength". Once God has proved us in this, He "manifests" Himself to us and changes our natures - but only if and when we want it, prepare for it, and volunteer for it. Unfortunately the majority of mankind never make it to this starting point and are just not teachable, not ready, not listening.</p>\n\n<p>It is illogical for us to "prove" God because we can only have 100% faith in a being that is perfect and all-powerful. If we allow that it''s possible for Him make a "mistake" or not have power to act in a given situation, then we can''t have complete faith in Him. Once this premise is accepted then the fallacy of mortals "proving" God to gain faith becomes apparent because the very idea of proving God is an admission that he might not be perfect and all powerful — which is the very thought that destroys faith.</p>\n\n<p>To follow God without reservation is a simple decision and way of living that frees us from doubts and anxiety. Join the sheepfold of God. Take the PRIME ELECTIVE.</p>\n<br>\n<br> - Jay Mackley', '', 'heart spirit believe love meek child born again humble treasure wisdom changed washed sanctified'),
(45, 'english', 'Purpose of Life', 'Doctrinal', '', 'Essay', '<br>\n<p><b>The Purpose of Life</b></p>\n\n<p>The scriptures indicate that we have always existed natively as "intelligences" and that we are, in that sense, eternal. At some point we were taken and favored by God to have additional capability by gaining a "spirit" and becoming His "sons and daughters". What the exact powers and advantages are to this step is not yet revealed in detail. What is known is that spirit entities have the ability to move, speak, and act within a certain realm and that the outward appearance of a spirit being resembles that of a mortal being. We are "spiritually created" by God in His image.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose and desire of our existence is to "progress", to grow in wisdom and experience and in our power to act. The next step required for "progression" is to obtain a physical mortal body for our spiritual bodies to inhabit. Because God is ethically and morally perfect, he has, in His wisdom, granted to us moral agency. We are not ordered about by Him – He is not a dictator. However, we are presented choices in our path of progression. He has given to us our moral agency as an inherent right.</p>\n\n<p>We exercised this agency in the pre-mortal realm as spirits. With two plans of progression laid out for us, we decided to live on the earth with mortal bodies in an environment with both good and evil and with the ongoing ability to choose between the two. That is, two thirds of us made that decision for the plan (call it plan A) that came with Gods personal endorsement. The other one third decided the hardships and risks of mortality were not worth it and chose plan B. Plan B required that we forfeit our moral agency but promised to be an easy path and to provide the benefits of Plan A but without the risks and hardships involved. The prime proponent of Plan A was Jesus and the prime proponent of Plan B was Lucifer. While it sounded good, the Plan B was a lie and a deception and a form of slavery. All of us who are born into mortality saw that Plan B was a lie, believed that it was flawed and explicitly choose Plan A. Having failed in their objective, Plan B proponents were angry and rebellious and were thus exiled from the presence of God. Plan A proponents (us) also leave the presence of God as we are, per Plan A, born into mortality. All these decisions and the eons of time prior to our birth are temporarily forgotten during mortality because of the temporary "veil of forgetfulness" drawn over our minds so we can exercise moral agency in an unbiased manner. However, our character and personality, forged in the pre-mortal existence, never leaves us - and that is what is being tested by the exercise of moral agency in mortality.</p>\n<br>In summary:\n<br>\n<br>Plan A<br>\n<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">\n<li>Retain moral agency.</li>                   \n<li>Exercise moral agency in mortality - difficulties expected.</li> \n<li>Choose Jesus Christ as our Savior.</li> \n<li>Return to live in the presence of God our Father.</li> \n</ol>\nPlan B<br>\n<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">\n<li>Forfeit moral agency.\n</li><li>Obey Lucifer in mortality - guarantee of no hardship.\n</li><li>Must accept Lucifer as our Savior.\n</li><li>Lucifer becomes our god and we live in his presence.\n</li></ol>\n<p>Having been rejected by God and by us, the Plan B proponents are engaged in doing all in their power to prove they were right by disrupting Plan A. They know that if we individually fail at Plan A then we won''t attain step 4 and perhaps Plan B will triumph after all.</p>\n\n<p>However, Lucifer''s Plan B is a lost cause. The major setback occurred in 33 AD, when Jesus accomplished His atonement, died for our sins and was resurrected. These acts assured Plan A''s ongoing success and guaranteed Plan B''s demise. Hardly any mortals will go for Plan B once they understand it. While he has ultimately failed and is miserable about it, Lucifer can still cause damage and at least temporarily make Plan B slaves out of us and this elevates his own ego and provides a purpose for his existence, which is to bring us under his control. However his time is short. Very short.</p>\n\n<p>Lucifer''s idea that he could defeat the plan of God was foolhardy - he never really had a chance. However, his opposition is a necessary part of step 2 of Plan A which is why God allows opposition by Plan B proponents.</p>\n\n<p>So we see that mortal life is "a set up" and not random at all. We are here enrolled in "Moral Agency School" and are now taking our lessons. We are graded on our performance and if do well we''ll graduate - hopefully with honors. Although we don''t remember, we signed up to attend mortality class and it''s only offered one time.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of life is not a contest between the forces for evil and good. After all, it is "no contest" when one side has the Supreme Being of the universe on it''s side. No, the purpose of life is for us to make correct moral decisions in an environment balanced between good and evil. This balance between the influences of good and evil, carefully allowed to evolve, includes but is not limited to our earth. It extends also into other spatial dimensions after death.</p> \n\n<p>It is finals week in Gods university. We all agreed to take the test of our own free will. Each test handed out is different and designed just for us. God is the Dean. He has assigned Jesus to teach the class and to grade the papers. At the end, some will graduate and go on to illustrious careers. Others will not. Yet all will have gained a great benefit from the educational experience.</p>\n<br>\n<br> - Jay Mackley\n<br>\n<br>P.S. Since our short earth life is explicitly set up and designed for us, it explains why random unscheduled visits from the intelligent beings on trillions of other planets are not occurring. The universe is not random. Our presence here is carefully planned out and monitored. Any visitors must have an important reason and assignment to come here. In any case, ours is a fallen world.

(46, 'english', 'Nature of God', 'Doctrinal', '', '', '<br><big><b><center>The Father</center></b></big>\n\n<p>He is the Supreme Being of the universe, the Father of the spirits of all mankind, and the One True God. He is the only one to whom we should pray. </p>\n\n<b>Names and Titles</b>\n\n<p>He is known as: 1) God; 2) God the Father; 3) Father; 4) Man of Holiness; 5) Elohim/Eloheim; 6) Man of Counsel; 7) Endless and Eternal.</p>\n\n<b>Physicality</b>\n\n<p>God the Father is not just a concept or philosophy but is an actual living Being – a perfect Man. He has a physical body of flesh and bones - but not with blood as mortals have. He is a being of light and energy and exists physically at a different level of existence than what we experience in mortality. In appearance He would appear to be in the prime of life, beyond what we would consider perfect in appearance. His hair is white. He can "read" and "speak" to our minds telepathically and also speaks verbally. When interacting with mortals He reduces His energy and brightness level and also "transfigures" men and women by temporarily changing their bodies so they are able to physically be in His presence.</p>\n\n\n<b>Power and Authority</b>\n\n<p>His body is "Celestial" which means it has certain inherent powers manifested in our physical world. This includes power over gravity, instant transportation, and command over the elements. Mentally, He has a perfect IQ and is like a perfect savant in all areas of expertise and skills, both mental and physical, and of course He never "forgets". The physical elements have a "native intelligence" which instantly respond to His commands and instructions. His power is more than just complete control over the elements through physical laws because He also actually has control over the physical laws of nature. He can change or suspend what the physical laws actually are at any given instant. In personal authority, the Father presides over all other living beings in this universe, including those who have themselves also attained a state of moral perfection. God The Father created all living beings in the universe and all life, both human and non-human. We all owe our existence and our allegiance to Him.</p>\n\n\n<b>Morality</b>\n\n<p>God has existed as a God for uncounted eons of time. He has seen and done more than we mortals can imagine. He long ago achieved moral perfection. He lacks for absolutely nothing. We can trust Him because everything He does is for us and not for Him. Because of His moral perfection and His foreknowledge He knew we needed to exercise our own moral agency in the next step of our advancement - even though He knew it would sometimes lead to sorrow and pain on our part. However, He provided that this phase would be as short as possible and also planned for us a way to get out from under the inevitable mistakes we would make with the exercise of our agency.</p>\n\n\n<b>Emotions and feelings</b>\n\n<p>God experiences the emotions of joy and happiness. This is His natural state. As He contemplates His children He also feels sorrow for the consequences of our mistakes (sins) and righteous anger for those who willfully rebel against Him. He is extremely patient, merciful and long suffering towards us. However, He rules the universe on divine principles (not emotion) that are fair and equitable to all and He never acts capriciously.</p>\n\n\n<b>Origin</b>\n\n<p>"As man is, God once was. As God is, man may become." This glorious principle means that God, the greatest of all, has gone through the same refining and learning process that He has set up for us to go through. He understands us. He knows, more than we do, what we need.</p>\n\n\n<b>Destiny</b>\n\n<p>He will exist throughout eternity in his glorified, perfected state - a state of joy and happiness. He is and always will be anxious to grow his eternal family and bring each individual he creates to the same state of perfection that He enjoys. That is His "work and glory".</p>\n\n\n<b>Relationship to Mankind</b>\n\n<p>Our Father in Heaven is our God, the one and only God to whom we pray. He created us as spirit entities and He considers each of us a member of His eternal family. He cares, personally and deeply, for each of us and has provided us a plan of progression and happiness. Because of His Godly powers he is aware at all times the thoughts and actions of all of his children. He loves us in a manner that is greater than what mortals can love. It''s because of that love that we can have confidence and faith in Him and our ultimate destiny which he oversees personally. He said that his "work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality of man". He never forgets us or leaves our destiny to chance.</p>\n\n\n<b>God the Father in history</b>\n\n<p>God the Father directed that the earth be created for us. He delegated this task so that the actual creative acts were accomplished by His Son Jesus Christ. In the Garden of Eden, the Father personally interacted and spoke with Adam and Eve and taught them. After the Fall of Man, Adam and Eve (and their descendants) "fell" or were removed from the presence of God the Father. Jesus Christ was introduced as the mediator between God the Father and mankind. The purpose of Christ''s mission and His assignment is to bring us back into the presence of God the Father of our Spirits. That is in fact our purpose - to get back to the presence of God the Father where we experience perfect joy and happiness as we continue to progress in becoming more like Him.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n<big><b><center>The Son</center></b></big>\n\n<b>Names and Titles</b>\n\n<p>Included are the following: Jesus Christ, Messiah, Jehovah, Advocate, Alpha and Omega, Son of God, Anointed One, Begotten Son, Bread of Life, Bridegroom, Comforter, Deliverer, Good Shepherd, I AM, Immanuel, Lamb of God, Living Water, Lord, Mediator, Redeemer, Savior, Son of Man, First Born, Second Comforter, the Bright and Morning Star.</p>\n\n\n<b>Physicality</b>\n\n<p>The Son''s spirit body was created by God the Father as the First Born. Thus, as a spirit entity, he is the born first of the Father, before the rest of us, and is also the Fathers only Begotten Son in mortality. Prior to his birth of the virgin Mary, the Son of God was known as Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament. In physical appearance the Son looks EXACTLY like the Father.</p>\n\n\n<b>Power and Authority</b>\n\n<p>God the Father has delegated His power and authority over the earth and over mankind to Jesus Christ. Jesus has His Fathers "power of attorney", to use a legal phrase. Thus, only through Jesus Christ can we qualify to return to the presence of our Father in Heaven. </p>\n\n\n<b>Morality</b>\n\n<p>Jesus attained moral perfection prior to physically coming to the earth. Jesus also led a perfect life while living in mortality in that he never committed sin. He set a perfect example for us to follow. He Himself has followed the example of God the Father and taught us what and how to do the same.</p>\n\n\n<b>Emotions and feelings</b>\n\n<p>Jesus has deep and poignant feelings towards us, who are also spiritually created by God the Father and are thus his brothers and sisters. Having done no sin, yet He turned the other cheek and suffered terribly in our behalf because of His love for us and for our Father in Heaven. He has shown us by His example what patience and love really mean. Yet he is not weak or a milquetoast but a strong leader. His is the perfect balance between mercy and strength, tenderness and strong leadership. Eventually, He is going to let the hammer fall on those who disobey God and who reject His words and sacrifice - if they fail to repent.</p>\n\n\n<b>Origin and Destiny</b>\n\n<p>Spiritually created and born of God the Father, Jesus attained moral perfection by following the example of His Father, then Jesus took a mortal body, which was later upgraded to perfected resurrected body. In this process, He has attained all the attributes and characteristics of His Father. He is a God in very fact and will remain so throughout the eternities of time.</p>\n\n<b>Role</b>\n\n<p>His role is to be a "mediator" between mankind and God the Father.  That by His grace we are enabled to overcome sin, obey His law, and return back into the presence of the Father. Since the Fall of Man, the Son has dealt with mankind on the earth in the name of the Father. In other words, the word of the Father comes to man always through the Son and also the actions of the Father are assigned to and actually performed by the Son. Another way of saying it is that the Son has power of attorney for the Father. In this role, the Son often speaks in scripture in the first person of the Father as though he were the Father. The Son does not act independently but always in total harmony and unity with God the Father.</p>\n\n<b>The Son of God in history</b>\n\n<p>Jesus Christ created the earth at the direction of our Father in Heaven. He was born of the virgin Mary and known in mortality as Jesus Christ. Prior to His physical creation He had a spirit body created by God the Father. Jesus is the only being whose Father is God in both spirit and physical bodies. In Old Testament times He filled His role as mediator between the Father and Mankind and was known as Jehovah, the great I AM. In mortality, He atoned for our sins, died on the cross, and was resurrected. For almost 2000 years,  He has had a perfected resurrected body like our Father in Heaven. He still fills His role as mediator and has often communicated the will of God the Father to holy prophets in modern times. He is soon going to return to the earth, destroy evil, and politically reign 1000 years with the righteous.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n<big><b><center>The Holy Ghost</center></b></big>\n\n<b>Names and Titles</b>\n\n<p>Included are the following: Spirit of God, Comforter, Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit</p>\n\n\n<b>Physicality</b>\n\n<p>Created as a spirit entity by God the Father. He has a body of spirit that, in appearance, is that of a man - although not physically tangible. Postponing the acquisition of physical body is intentional for Him to fulfill His role as a teacher who testifies of divine truths by telepathic means and who can be literally in our presence without our seeing Him with our physical eyes.</p>\n\n\n<b>Power and Authority</b>\n\n<p>All covenants made with the Father must be sealed and ratified by the Holy Ghost or they are invalid, moot. For example, going through the motions of baptism does not avail us the blessing unless we first repent of our sins and seek God with all our hearts. When we do this the Holy Ghost ratifies the ordinance, meaning that it then becomes effective meaning that we become "sanctified or sealed by the spirit". This state can be lost though sin. It can be restored by true repentance. It is the same with every blessing that is initiated through gospel ordinances: baptism, receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost, temple ordinances and eternal marriage. That is, it must be ratified, approved by, and sealed by the Holy Ghost.</p> \n\n\n<b>Morality</b>\n\n<p>Like the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost has attained moral perfection. In all His actions He is in total harmony with God the Father. His work is done under the direction of God the Father.</p>\n\n\n<b>Emotions and feelings</b>\n\n<p>The Holy Ghost delights in righteousness and when we yield to His influence to do what is right. On the other hand, He is offended and leaves us when we sin and seek to fill our lives with evil behavior. In such cases, he will leave us to our own devices and without His whispered guidance. To the unbaptized, His presence can be felt in short intervals by those who earnestly seek it. To those who are baptized for repentance and who receive The gift of the Holy Ghost by proper ordination, His presence can be felt at all times in our thoughts and feelings - if we do not drive Him away.</p>\n\n\n<b>Origin and Destiny</b>\n\n<p>He is a spirit child of God the Father and made covenant with the Father and Son to help bring us back to the presence of the Father. At some point He will continue his eternal progression by taking on a perfected resurrected body as both the Father and Son have already done.</p>\n\n<b>Role</b>\n\n<p>He is a teacher, comforter, and testifier of truth. He speaks to us by the "still small voice" and helps communicate the will of God to us. His role is also to augment our hope and faith and give us spiritual guidance and strength during our difficult mortal trials. Although He is not the Father physically, He has perfect knowledge and communication with the Father. He knows and always does exactly what the Father would do in each situation.</p>\n\n\n<b>The Holy Ghost in history</b>\n\n<p>He baptized Adam. He has interacted with all the Holy Prophets and righteous Saints on the earth. Every decision for the right throughout history bears His imprint and He strives to influence men and women to do good. When the Spirit of God is withdrawn from a nation, moral and physical destruction soon follow.</p>\n<br>\n<br> - Jay Mackley\n<br>', '', 'Father Man God Holiness Elohim Counsel Endless Eternal flesh body bones speak mind celestial authority command commandments work glory joy happiness state glory glorified heaven Heaven love mediator presence Jesus Christ, Messiah Jehovah Advocate Alpha Omega Son Anointed One Begotten Bridegroom Comforter Deliverer Good Shepherd I AM Immanuel Lamb Water Lord Mediator Redeemer Savior Man First Born Second Comforter temple ordinances temple marriage baptism Holy Ghost Spirit spirit repentance sanctify sanctification justify justification perfect'),

It''s not just a simple solution of "Heaven or Hell" because <u>that</u> would negate the justice of God. Every person is unique and so there are many shades of judgment necessary for perfect justice to be served. Jesus made this very clear when He said "<i>In my Fathers house there are many mansions</i>". This  <a href="http://theholyscriptures.info/ldsblog/essays2/the-great-plan-of-salvation/images/POS2.jpg" class="editlink" rel="lytebox" title="The Plan of Salvation, destinations" onclick="myLytebox.start(this, false, false); return false;">diagram</a> shows Gods plan for the human family from a "location destination" point of view. The diagram helps get your bearings but is not able to present the total plan of God that includes Christ''s complete role and the moral path God has outlined for our safety.</p>\n\n<p><u>Section 76</u> of the <u>Doctrine and Covenants</u> is the most profound doctrinal Revelation ever given to mankind, of which we have record (IMO). In it, the effects of the future judgments of God, the destiny of the earth, and the destiny of mankind, are outlined with crystal clarity. At least some of this knowledge was on the earth in ancient times but was lost until revealed again to both Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in an "open vision" on February 16, 1832.</p>\n\n<b><big>PRE-MORTAL REALM</big></b>\n<p>When God clothed our native "intelligence" with a spirit body, we became a part of His vast family and lived in His presence for billions of years before receiving our physical body in mortality. We were aware of the creation and preparation of the earth, provided our input into the process and looked forward with great anxiety and joy to the day when we could actually be physically born into it. We waited and prepared a very long time for this, for this small pinprick in time when all that we learned, all that we planned, would be put into execution. Part of the mortal experience is that we lose our memories of the pre-mortal time - while still retaining our individual personalities, native talents, and moral propensities. We were also aware of the tremendous risks a level playing field would imply. We could lose. We could choose wrong. But most of us, two thirds of us, trusted in our Fathers plan and were confident and maybe even over confident, of our abilities and advanced preparation, so we choose to be born into mortality. However, the other third rebelled and so were sent to earth without mortal birth. They preferred the "safer" plan of Lucifer who guaranteed success by replacing moral free agency with a guarantee of forced success. Lucifer had proposed we trade in our freedom to make our own moral choices - and have him installed as our king, and proposed that he receive all power and honor in his alternate plan.</p>\n\n<b><big>MORTALITY ON EARTH</big></b>\n<p>So now we are here, on our own, having left our Fathers house. He knew that leaving was best for us to learn about good and evil by our own personal experience and He carefully provided a plan for us to return to Him. We have the ability here to choose right from wrong, and God provides that we can choose Him by accepting His son Jesus Christ, and His atonement which can make us clean again from our inevitable mistakes (sins) and worthy to return to our God and Father that made us. However, for right now it is still war -- a war between Gods plan and Lucifer''s plan. Lucifer lost the war when Jesus successfully accomplished His mission on earth and yet the battle is not over, until the end of the world. Lucifer is miserable about his defeat but wants to inflict as many casualties as possible while he still can. This is because of pride, ego, revenge, and bitterness. His legions currently have us mortals outnumbered 6 to 1 and they''ve had almost 6000 years of practice in influencing the minds of men and women and binding them down with the chains of ignorance, bad habits, chemical and emotional dependency, lies, various sin, and outright deception. Yet we have within us the real power that our enemy can only dream about. We have physical power because of our bodies and we have the God of heaven as an all powerful ally that we can call to our aid. Once armed with the truth of God we can unmask the enemy and destroy him, crush him.</p><p>\n\n<b><big>PARADISE and SPIRIT PRISON</big></b>\n</p><p>The next phase of our existence is to go either to Paradise or Spirit Prison. There is a preliminary judgment that occurs at death that determines the condition we inhabit in the spirit world, the power that we have, and the company we keep. Here are the basic classifications of those in the Spirit World:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>The righteous who accepted Jesus Christ while in mortality and were baptized and received the Holy Ghost by a real servant of God having actual Priesthood power from God. These people have joy and rest from earthly temptations and sorrows. They typically did not hold any political power in mortality but they have total power over the wicked in the spirit world. They are the leaders in the spirit world and dwell in that portion of the Spirit World known as Paradise. In some cases they have already been resurrected, after Jesus was resurrected, so that they could carry out special assignments in building Gods Kingdom and caring for His children. These now dwell in Heaven, the Celestial City of Zion, and are soon to be joined by their spiritual siblings residing now residing in Paradise.</li>\n<li>The unbaptized righteous who have sought the will of God with faith are placed with others of the same persuasion. They heard about and accepted Jesus Christ while in mortality, at least somewhat, but had no opportunity for baptism. They also have joy and rest from earthly temptations and sorrows. Yet they look forward to accepting baptism and to their resurrection day and in the meantime are very busy organizing and promoting Gods Kingdom in the spirit world in whatever way they can. Eventually, when their time comes, each of these receive and accept their baptism, and other sacred covenants, by a living proxy in the Holy Temples of God. Then, as they are worthy, they become just like those of step 1 above.</li>\n<li>Well intentioned people who never heard of Jesus or His gospel while living on the earth, including children. In the spirit world they hear, are glad for it, and accept it. Almost all people of this class accept Jesus while on the other side and join with those of step 2. From the perspective of being in the spirit world, accepting the gospel of Christ is pretty much a no-brainer. All those of step 1-3 go on to receive a Celestial resurrection and live on a Celestialized earth - the understanding of which surpasses human comprehension.</li>\n<li>Good people who nevertheless rejected the true gospel plan while in mortality. They may have heard about it but chose to ignore it for selfish reasons. In some cases they were deceived by Lucifer because they refused to cultivate the presence of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Almost all of these accept the true plan of Christ in the spirit world but they cannot accept a proxy baptism in the spirit world that they rejected in mortality, so their advancement potential is forever limited. They cannot join those of step 1. These inherit a Terrestrial resurrection and dwell together in eternity on a distinct sphere from those of  Celestial or Telestial resurrection. The Terrestrial world is way more advanced and beautiful than our present earth. It is also a distinct upgrade from the Telestial sphere of existence. </li>\n<li>The dead who were and remain outright wicked and evil are confined and restricted in their actions so they can not hurt or bother anyone. In mortality they loved to hurt and oppressed others. They thought they were "winning" but their "victories" at this point ring very hollow as they realize all their efforts were misspent. They may have had it for a day but they eventually come to realize that the meek and humble inherit the earth FOREVER. The wicked continue to associate with and be influenced by the evil spirits that followed Lucifer prior to mortality. However now they are all powerless, slaves to evil, literally in prison and can do nothing about it and, as a result, are in pain of both mind and spirit. They are not looking forward to facing God at the final judgment day where they know they must directly pay for each and every one of their sins - with the exact same level of suffering as Christ had in Gethsemane and on the cross. Eventually, those of a Telestial resurrection inherit a sphere of Telestial glory which is still far, far more advanced and wonderful than our present earth. </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone who has ever been born on the earth gets resurrected. It is their right, for keeping their "first estate" (i.e. agreeing to come to earth) in the pre-mortal world. The resurrection comes through the merits of Jesus Christ. He broke the bands of death for EVERYONE and this is why I said earlier that Lucifer has already been defeated. Everyone who has a body has power over those who do not, both now and especially in the eternities of time. The resurrection itself is more that just getting a body back again because a resurrected body is always a perfected body with no flaws that also comes with various new powers. However, not all resurrected bodies are equal in the sense of the power that is granted at the time of the resurrection. All of these potential powers are not defined in completeness but do include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Power to transport oneself from one location to another. (C1,C2,C3,~T1,~T2).</li>\n<li>Mental powers and abilities which are, in all cases, much greater than what we have in mortality (C1,~C2,~C3,~T1,~T2,).</li>\n<li>Power over the elements, to control and construct or reconstruct matter (C1,C2,C3) and power over gravity.</li>\n<li>A level of inherent light energy or "glory" (C1,~C2,~C1,~T1,~T2).</li>\n<li>Telepathic ability to read the thoughts of others, and to instantly know of their background (C1,C2,C3,~T1,~T2,).</li>\n<li>Power to procreate (C1).</li>\n<li>Ability to see the past and to see into the future (C1,C2,C3).</li>\n<li>A perfectly functioning body and mind that is not subject to any illness or to the aging process (C1,C1,C3,T1,T2).</li>\n<li>A body is that is beautiful and functional beyond mortal possibilities (C1,C2,C3,~T1,~T2).</li>\n<li>Mentally, a total freedom from temptation or deception (C1,C2,C3,T1,T2).</li>\n<li>A knowledge of God and family and truth that provides ongoing joy (C1,C2,C3,~T1,~T2).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<br>C1 = Celestial resurrection with eternal marriage (including C2   C3)<br>C2 = Celestial resurrection with temple covenants (including C3)<br>C3 = Celestial resurrection with baptismal covenant<br>T1 = Terrestrial resurrection<br>T2 = Telestial resurrection<br>~ indicates "to a lesser degree"\n<br>', '', ''),
